# Tate Runner

Hey! Welcome to the official repository of my **2D-Scroller Game** called TateRunner. During my first year of Software Engineering, I had 8 weeks to work on a game. I chose to almost completely write it from scratch, and ended up with a pretty awesome game, if I may say so myself!

&nbsp;

### ðŸ’» Software

I wrote this project in C++ using the Arduino framework, which I learned by following multiple classes at my university
and doing a lot of research online. By combining a very intelligent IDE like Clion by Jetbrains, and Platformio, I was
able to write and test my code very efficiently.

#### Launching the Game (!! **Java17 REQUIRED** !!)

```java
public final class TateRunnerBootstrap {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try {
			// Initialize the game and call the start game function
			final TateRunnerGame tateRunner = new TateRunnerGame();
			tateRunner.startGame(args);

			// Add a shutdown hook to the runtime
			Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(tateRunner::stopGame));
		} catch (Throwable throwable) {
			throwable.printStackTrace();
			System.exit(throwable.hashCode());
		}
	}
}
```

You can start the game by running the TateRunnerBootstrap. This will initialize the game and call the startGame function. It will also add a shutdown hook to the runtime, which will call the stopGame function when the game is closed.
_Java 17 is required to run the game._
